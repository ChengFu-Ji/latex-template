\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the volume of data contained by the big data has increased rapidly, and huge data will generate a lot of applications. Every application generates data exchange. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a common network data exchange format. With the growth of Internet data, it also has the characteristics of big data. This study constructs the XML Veracity Application Programming Interface (XML Veracity Model API) to solve the problem that the realism of big data is not easy to quantify in data transmission. The truth of XML file is based on data understandability and can be interpreted and used. Veracity Model API, users can design their own dimensions and attributes of document realism and generate quantified scores. In order to respond to the increase in the application of streaming data today, and because of the structural problems of streaming XML data, it is difficult to verify the realism. This study applies the Veracity model to streaming data and uses Apache Spark to increase the processing performance of the model to achieve the purpose of quickly processing streaming XML and verifying the design architecture of the realism model.\\
